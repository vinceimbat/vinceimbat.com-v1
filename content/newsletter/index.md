I currently have two active newsletters.

## [_Lilim_](/tags/lilim)

_Lilim_, which means "shade" or "shadow," is a weekly newsletter about walking in Laguna, Pangasinan, and elsewhere in the Philippines.

## [_Uman_](/tags/uman)

_Uman_ means "change." It is a monthly newsletter sent every first week of the month, documenting what it means to pursue philosophy, contemplation, and writing independently as a way of life.
