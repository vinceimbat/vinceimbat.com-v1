I am not afraid to write in a new journal.

Why would I? If journaling brings fear, why would I do it? The point of journaling, at least for me, is to express myself in writing in a frictionless, fearless manner.

A journal shouldn't be something that stresses me out. It becomes one if I treat it like something to "show off". For some people, journaling is their art form and their [journal pages](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/bulletjournal/) are something they show to the world. This works great for them and I find many of their works inspiring.

However, this is something I prefer not to doâ€”[if I can help it](https://www.instagram.com/p/B9qGbATBaR2/). I have [so much history with journaling](my-journaling-system-june-2018/) that prevents me from taking that path. A journal, for me, has always been the safest place I can be. And during times like these, I cling to it a lot, because even if I don't admit it to others (or to myself) often, I do am afraid right now.

I've said things in my journals I won't tell anyone. Writing in them have sustained me emotionally for almost three years now since I started getting serious with them. With a daily journaling practice, I've become less anxious, less sad, and less afraid. Without this practice, I'll be more afraid than I am now.

While my journals are also slowly transforming into flower beds for ideas I share in this blog (this post being an example), it will always be primarily a place of retreat. I feel calmer knowing that there is always a safe place I could run to when things get tough.
