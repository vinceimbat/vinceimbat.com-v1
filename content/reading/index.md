This is where I keep track of the books I read. The books are arranged in reverse chronological order with the most recent on top.

Starred (★) entries are good reads. Double-starred (★★) entries are must-reads.

Numbers in parentheses represent the month I finished reading the book.

I borrowed the idea for this page from [Frank Chimero](https://frankchimero.com/reading/), which I learned through [Austin Kleon](https://austinkleon.com/tag/my-reading-year/) ([who also keeps his own list](https://austinkleon.com/tag/my-reading-year/)).
